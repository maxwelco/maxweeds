abstract = "Widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds has further limited effective POST-emergence herbicide options in soybean (*Glycine max* (L.) Merr.) leading to an increased adoption of PRE-emergence herbicides. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of 11 commonly used PRE herbicides on soybean development, root nodulation, and symbiotic N fixation. Soybean plants were grown under greenhouse conditions in pots (10 L; 4 plants per pot) filled with silt loam soil and treated one day after planting with a labeled field rate of imazethapyr, chlorimuron-ethyl, cloransulam-methyl, metribuzin, sulfentrazone, flumioxazin, saflufenacil, acetochlor, S-metolachlor, dimethenamid-P, pyroxasulfone and no herbicide (nontreated control). Sulfentrazone reduced soybean canopy at the VC growth stage but no canopy reduction was observed at the V2 growth stage from any of the herbicide treatments. At the R2 growth stage, herbicides had no effect on soybean development (root and shoot biomass), root nodulation (# nodule per plant, nodule diameter, and nodule biomass) and symbiotic N fixation (acetylene reduction assay and 15N natural abundance). According to our findings, although PRE herbicides may slightly affect early-season soybean development, the impacts on plant growth, root nodulation, and symbiotic N fixation were negligible. Thus, when sprayed according to the label, the benefits of PRE herbicides for weed control likely outweigh any potential concern regarding soybean development, root nodulation, and N fixation."
