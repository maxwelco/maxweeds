abstract = "The successful commercial use of carrot depends on the choice of cultivars that are well-adapted to soil and climate conditions at the cultivation site and on good consumer acceptance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of carrot cultivars grown in autumn-winter in two towns with different climatic characteristics, in the High Jequitinhonha Valley, MG, Brazil. The experiments were conducted on the Rio Manso farm, in the town of Couto de Magalhães de Minas and on Campus JK at UFVJM, in the town of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Six carrot cultivars (Brasília, Nantes, Kuronan, Esplanada, Planalto and Tornado) were evaluated using a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The following morpho-agronomic characteristics were evaluated 100 days after sowing: shoot height, root length, root dry matter, total dry matter, harvest index, commercial yield and total yield root. The most suitable cultivars in Diamantina were Planalto, Tornado and Kuronan, and the cultivatar Planalto was the best suited to Couto de Magalhães de Minas. The agronomic performance of the cultivars was higher in Couto de Magalhães de Minas for the majority of the study variables, resulting in a higher total yield and commercial root yield. The climatic and soil conditions of Diamantina induced flowering in most cultivars, causing a loss to the commercial yield in autumnwinter cultivation."
