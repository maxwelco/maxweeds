title: Making Available R Codes for Crop-Weed Competition Research
---

My colleagues and I published a manuscript entitled [Additive design: the concept and data analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/wre.12317). Great thanks to Dr. [Rodrigo Werle](http://www.wiscweeds.info/) and Dr. [Stevan Knezevic](https://agronomy.unl.edu/knezevic)

As described in the summary above, this a method paper where we also provided the R codes for data analysis in [**RStudio**](https://rstudio.com). The original dataset is available for those who do not have crop-weed competition data but are willing to learn the modelling skills.

Making R codes available to everyone is part of my **Open Source Weed Science** project. In the next posts, I will be including more R codes for data analysis of weed research studies.
