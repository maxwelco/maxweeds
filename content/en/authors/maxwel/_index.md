I am a PhD research scientist at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Professor at Western SÃ£o Paulo University. I am also a consultant, a [speaker](/talks) and I teach Biology and Management of Weed Species and Data Science to undergrad and graduate students. Contrary to popular belief, I do research in weed but not that kind of weed. I am passionate about plant science, data science, and programming.
