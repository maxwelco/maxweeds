abstract = "Intercropping is a common practice among farmers in tropical regions of the world and has persisted for years, not only for traditional reasons, but also for certain advantages that helped in its ecological adaptation. In regard to low income farmers with small areas for cultivation, more attention should be given to the cost of production and better land management. Thus, the aim of this work was to determine the best intercropping system of cassava with other crops. The experiment was conducted in an area belonging to the cassava (Manihot esculenta) producers of the Planalto de Minas district in Diamantina, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The treatments comprised cassava intercropped with maize, beans and dwarf pigeon pea, as well as controls with and without weeding. The dry mass of shoots for maize, beans and dwarf-pigeon pea was affected by the presence of cassava. The productivity of cassava was dependent on cultivar and the intercropped crop. The highest harvest indexes were observed when cassava was intercropped with maize. In a general way, intercropping with maize and beans showed the highest area equivalence indexes and are recommended for the cassava crop."
