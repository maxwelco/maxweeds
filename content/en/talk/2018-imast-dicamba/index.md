> This workshop conference was organized by the SÃ£o Paulo State University, Brazil, the official language was Portuguese.

I was a keynote invited speaker. In this talk I showed the evolution of herbicide resistance in the United States, and the new technologies, such as dicamba and 2,4-D resistant crops. These crops will be available to Brazilian growers in 2021.
