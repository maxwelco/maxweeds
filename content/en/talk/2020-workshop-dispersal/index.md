> This workshop conference was organized by the University of Viçosa, Brazil, official language was Portuguese.

In this talk I have showed examples of weed dispersal, mostly herbicide resistant weeds. I have commented on how herbicide resistance weed dispersal are contributing to the increase on herbicide resistant weed in Brazil and in the United States.
