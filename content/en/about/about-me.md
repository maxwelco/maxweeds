I am from Ipatinga, Minas Gerais. I have a BSc in Agronomy and a MSc in Plant Science at the [Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri](http://www.ufvjm.edu.br/). I received my PhD in Agronomy & Weed Science at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/) in 2017.

My first experience in the United States was during my undergraduate period. I have completed a 12 month on job training in the United States through [The Ohio Program](https://top.osu.edu/). I have worked in a specialty crop farm in Michigan, and in a hydroponic tomato greenhouses in New York.

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0001-5398-1234) is focused on modeling weed management in agro and natural ecosystems. I have written and collaborated in many scientific [publications](/publication) about surveys, management, ecology, biology and resistance of weeds. I have also presented and collaborated to research/extension posters and talks in international conferences.

In Nebraska, I started to analyze my research studies with the statistical programming language SAS and R. I became an avid user of R. I have taught R in workshops and I current teach R classes to graduate students.
